# Decoder-Ring

## What is it?
Cypher application that will support encoding/decoding using Caesar, Polybius Square and Substition techniques.  This is my favorite assignment so far. My 1st extra credit coding assignment in High School was to develop a cypher (code and decode) algorithm in Pascal. I really enjoy coding cypher alghorithms, and this app has 3.  Woot!! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Why?
The focus of this assignment was to demonstrate wide profiency across all JavaScript capabilities developed thus far into the program (and then some) in additon to unit tests. 

## My Focus
My focus as a student has been purely on the JavaScript in the src folder in addition to unit tests in the test folder. The HTML and CSS were developed by THINKFUL. 

## Bonus
I also added some techniques not covered such as while loops, and regex functions. It just seemed natural, and the solution called for it. ðŸ™‚
